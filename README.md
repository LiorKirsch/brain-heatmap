Run exampleMain.m (from matlab).
* Matlab will generate a csv file which hold the region ID and the color of that region in hex.


Then run the python script to generate the heatmaps.
* The python script will load the colors from the csv file. 
* Then it will modify the svg atlas images and save the new images to the output folder.


If you have any problems while running the python script try install beautiful soup
